This bot allows users to message the bot as if they were messaging the other person. The bot is able to forward stickers and media.

# for admins
Each participant is given a `name` (need not be related to real name nor telegram id), and automatically generated `uuid`. Details such as telegram ID will be automatically captured. angel/mortal pairings are captured when registering. Each person can have up to one angel and up to one mortal.
## Set up
Create two telegram bots through botfather.
Put the prefix and bot tokens into a `.env` file in the root directory with the format:
```
PREFIX=mmvp
ANGEL_BOT_TOKEN=
MORTAL_BOT_TOKEN=
```

Create a txt file in the root directory, containing pairs in the format `<person1>, <person2>`  
Names will automatically be captured. A unique ID will be generated for each name.  
For example, if the following file is loaded
```
a, b
b, c
c, a
```
Three new persons representing a/b/c will be created. IDs will be shown for each, for example
```
a - 123456789
b - 234678590
c - 098234752
```

# for users
## to start
Start both bots. Then, message either one bot (not both) with `/r <ID>` to register. You should now be able to message both your angel and mortal.
